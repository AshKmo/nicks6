# This is an implementation of the factorial and Y combinator functions #

(\let

# the Y combinator function (called 'rec' in this case) #

# a function called 'if' that accepts a condition and two values and then returns one based on the condition #
let (\c \a \b [b, a].(c)) \if

# the factorial function #
